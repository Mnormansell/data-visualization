# Visualization of President's Tweets
* An interactive web application that visualizes the topics of Trump's tweets over time.
* Data parsed from an online database is translated with D3 to a dynamic, circular layout that reflects frequency of topic.
* C3 is used to add graphical summaries that capture topic quantities that the circular layout cannot.
